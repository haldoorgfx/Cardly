## What Cardly Is

Cardly is a SaaS tool that lets event organizers and designers create personalized "I'm Attending" social cards for event attendees.

**Flow:**
1. Designer uploads an event design (PNG/JPG)
2. Designer defines editable zones (name, title, photo, role)
3. Designer publishes → gets a public shareable link
4. Attendee opens the link on a phone, fills in info, uploads a photo
5. Attendee downloads a personalized PNG to share on social media

**MVP scope:** static image cards only. No video, no animation, no team accounts, no marketplace.

**Edge over competitors (Premagic, CrowdCard):** designer-native. The designer uploads their own design — no template constraints. Built for event organizers and designers worldwide.

## Design Handoff

The folder `cardly-handoff/cardly/project/` contains 13 HTML prototypes exported from Claude Design. **These are the source of truth for all UI.**

Files to read:
- A1 Landing Page.html
- A2 Pricing Page.html
- B1 Auth.html
- C1 Empty Dashboard.html
- C2 Events List.html
- C3 Event Detail.html
- D1 Upload Design.html
- D2 Canvas Editor.html (already a working React component with drag/resize/zoom — port carefully)
- D3 Publish and Share.html
- E1 Attendee Public Page.html (mobile-first, 375px viewport target)
- E2 Preview State.html
- E3 Success.html

**Rule:** Read the HTML files directly. Match colors, spacing, fonts, shadows, animations exactly. No reinterpretation. No "I think this looks better."

## Brand System (pulled from the HTML — do not change)

**Colors**
- Primary: `#6c63ff`
- Secondary: `#f8a4d8`
- Ink: `#0f0f1a`
- Off-white: `#fafafa`
- Border: `#e5e5ea`
- Gradient: `linear-gradient(135deg, #6c63ff 0%, #f8a4d8 100%)`

**Typography**
- Display: DM Sans (headings, letter-spacing -0.02em)
- Sans: Inter (body, UI)
- Mono: JetBrains Mono (labels, IDs, code)

**Shadows**
- `soft`: `0 1px 2px rgba(15,15,26,0.04), 0 8px 24px rgba(15,15,26,0.06)`
- `lift`: `0 4px 12px rgba(15,15,26,0.06), 0 24px 60px rgba(108,99,255,0.12)`

**Animations**
- `floatA` / `floatB` — hero floaters
- `zonePulse` — editor zone outlines
- `marquee` — logo strip
- `blink` — caret

Port the full Tailwind config from `A1 Landing Page.html` into `tailwind.config.ts`.

---

## Tech Stack (locked)

- **Framework:** Next.js 14, App Router, TypeScript (strict)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **UI primitives:** shadcn/ui (button, input, card, dialog, dropdown-menu, tabs, badge, toast, avatar)
- **Database + Auth + Storage:** Supabase
- **Image rendering:** `sharp` (server-side, in API route only)
- **Forms:** react-hook-form + zod
- **State:** React Context for global, useState for local. No Redux, no Zustand.
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Package manager:** pnpm

**Do not add:** Redis, edge functions, microservices, GraphQL, tRPC, any state-management library, any CSS-in-JS library.

## Database Schema (Supabase)

```sql
create table profiles (
  id uuid primary key references auth.users on delete cascade,
  email text unique,
  full_name text,
  plan text default 'free',           -- free | pro | studio
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

create table events (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid references profiles(id) on delete cascade,
  name text not null,
  slug text unique not null,
  background_url text,
  background_width int,
  background_height int,
  zones jsonb not null default '[]'::jsonb,
  status text default 'draft',        -- draft | published | archived
  view_count int default 0,
  download_count int default 0,
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  updated_at timestamptz default now()
);

create table generated_cards (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  event_id uuid references events(id) on delete cascade,
  attendee_name text,
  attendee_data jsonb,
  output_url text,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);
```

**Zones JSON shape:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "z1",
    "type": "text",
    "label": "Full Name",
    "x": 100, "y": 200, "w": 400, "h": 60,
    "font": "Inter", "size": 32, "weight": 600,
    "color": "#0f0f1a", "align": "center",
    "required": true,
    "placeholder": "Your name"
  },
  {
    "id": "z2",
    "type": "photo",
    "label": "Photo",
    "x": 200, "y": 400, "w": 200, "h": 200,
    "shape": "circle",
    "required": true
  }
]
```

**RLS policies:**
- Users can read/write only their own rows in `events` and `generated_cards`.
- Public can `select` from `events` where `status = 'published'` filtered by `slug`.
- Public can `insert` into `generated_cards`.

## Build Order (do not skip ahead)

### Phase 1 — Foundation
1. `pnpm create next-app` with TypeScript + Tailwind + App Router
2. Port the full Tailwind config from the HTML
3. Set up Supabase project; output `.env.local.example`
4. Install shadcn primitives listed above
5. Write the migration SQL
6. Build auth (signup, login, logout, protected routes via middleware)
7. Build the marketing nav + footer
8. Build A1 Landing Page

**STOP. Wait for human review before continuing.**

### Phase 2 — Designer App
9. Dashboard (C1 empty + C2 list, conditional on event count)
10. D1 Upload Design → upload to Supabase storage → create event row
11. C3 Event Detail page
12. D2 Canvas Editor — port the existing React component from the HTML. Wire it to save `zones` to the database with **800ms debounced auto-save**. Keep undo/redo.
13. D3 Publish & Share — generate slug (`event-name-xxxx`), mark as published, show link + QR

**STOP. Wait for human review.**

### Phase 3 — Attendee Experience (mobile-first, 375px first)
14. Public route `/c/[slug]` (E1) — load event, render background + zones, mobile form
15. `/api/render` — `sharp`-based image composition:
    - Load background from Supabase storage
    - Composite text zones with correct font, size, color, alignment
    - Composite photo cropped to shape (circle / square / rounded)
    - Return final PNG
    - Apply "Made with Cardly" watermark if user.plan === 'free'
16. E2 Preview — rendered card + download + share buttons
17. E3 Success — confirmation, suggested caption, share prompts

**STOP. End-to-end test: designer creates → attendee personalizes → downloads.**

### Phase 4 — Pricing & Polish
18. A2 Pricing
19. Plan limits: free = 1 event + watermark, pro = 10 events, studio = unlimited
20. View + download analytics on event detail page
21. Error states, loading states, empty states across all screens

---

## Critical Rules

1. **Match the design exactly.** Pull color, spacing, font sizes, shadows from the HTML files. No interpretation.
2. **Mobile attendee experience is non-negotiable.** Test E1 at 375px viewport. One-thumb operable. No tiny tap targets.
3. **Port the canvas editor, do not rewrite.** D2 already has working drag/resize/zoom logic in React.
4. **Server-side image rendering only.** Never use html2canvas or browser-based rendering. Use `sharp` in API route.
5. **Watermark logic:** "Made with Cardly" bottom-center, small, semi-transparent. Only on free tier output.
6. **Slug format:** `lowercase-event-name-xxxx` where `xxxx` is a 4-char random suffix.
7. **Auto-save:** 800ms debounce after last change in the editor.
8. **TypeScript strict mode.** Type zones, database rows, API request/response.
9. **No premature optimization.** No caching layers, no edge runtime, no SSG where SSR works fine.
10. **Don't ask design questions.** The designs are final. Just implement.

## Definition of Done (MVP)

- A new user can sign up, upload a design, define zones, publish, and get a shareable link.
- An attendee can open the link on a phone, fill in info, upload a photo, and download a personalized PNG.
- The downloaded PNG visually matches the live preview.
- Free tier shows watermark; paid tier doesn't.
- Deployed on Vercel.
- Works on mobile Safari + Chrome.

## Communication Style with the Human

The human (Abdalla) is a designer, not a backend engineer. When you explain things:

- Be direct. No hedging.
- No corporate language.
- Show code. Then explain in 1–2 lines what it does.
- If something will take >30 minutes or break working features, **ask first**.
- If you hit an architectural fork, present 2 options max with a recommendation.
- Don't ask permission for routine implementation choices.
- If a request conflicts with this CLAUDE.md, point it out before complying.

---

## Things That Will Break the Build (do not do)

- Adding any library not listed in Tech Stack above
- Switching to Pages Router
- Using browser-based image rendering (html2canvas, dom-to-image, etc.)
- Skipping the design files and "improving" the UI from memory
- Adding features beyond MVP scope (templates marketplace, team accounts, video output, AI features)
- Running ahead of the Build Order without human review at each STOP point
